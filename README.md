# a_docker_server_profiling_configuration
A docker server profiling configuration based on the docker or the pod ip address and it will print the latency in your terminal. I wrote this code after the  after the Brian Hass post on the latency [post](https://github.com/brianjohnhaas/PingplotterByChatgpt) and my code and comment also mentioned there [post](https://github.com/brianjohnhaas/PingplotterByChatgpt/issues/1).

To not to kill the process to show the plot like did in the image, you can put a sleep command and that will automatically stop the system lag after the sleep and will produce the plot. Let me know if you find it difficult and i will put that one also.
